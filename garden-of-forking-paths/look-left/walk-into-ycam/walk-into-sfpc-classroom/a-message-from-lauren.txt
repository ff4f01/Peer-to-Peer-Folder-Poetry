At SFPC, the length of time you're here isn’t going to be your most valuable asset - it’s the access to other people who are also excited, interested and supportive about what you are doing. This is how we learn, from each other. It’s in sharing our goals and questions with each other and listening and being open to other people’s feedback, perspectives and their experiences. It’s in the support and encouragement we can give each other. It’s the community we build around us.
