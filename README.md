## Peer-to-Peer Poetry: Invisible Cities

What if we could create and inhabit a new kind of digital city that transforms our online networks from an ordained protocol to an expressive medium of shared placemaking? In this workshop we will collectively create a peer-to-peer city using the structure of nested folders and [DAT](https://dat.foundation/). Taking up after Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities and the common practice of digital organization, through lecture, examples, and hands on making, we will explore folder structures as a new kind of poetic meter and DAT as a way to build digital spaces with and for our networks.


This workshop assumes no coding experience and simultaneously takes the position that everyone who interacts with computers in some way is already a programmer.

## Session Objectives

- To create a space where we are having a conversation with computers and writing poetry with their logic
- To develop a taste for creating emotive and community centered software.
- To introduce [DAT](https://dat.foundation/) and navigatinh the Command Line with [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
- To create poetry through building a folder-based city on the peer-to-peer web for each other to inhabit during the duration of the workshop and beyond

## Vocabulary
**Word** | **Definition**
--- | ---
folder | (also referred to as directory) is an organizational regime imposed on your computer used to store and organize files and other folders
file | is an object on a computer which stores data, information, settings, or commands to be used with various computer programs
file types/formats/extensions | indicate how data has been stored and how to read or open files in specific programs. for example, `.txt` files open in a text editor, `.jpg` files open in an image viewer/editor. full list of file formats and extensions [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_formats)
file path | tells you the location of a file in a system. for example `users/username/desktop/folder_poetry_club`
terminal | is a way to get text based access to your operating system
terminal commands | give you the ability to control your computer using command prompts. for example, terminal commands on mac computers are written in a language called bash
bash | is the programming language we use in the terminal, often one line at a time, but we can also put bash code in a file and run that file

## File organization
- Naming files and folders
    - All lowercase
    - No spaces, under scores and dashes are ok (for example, `my_folder` or `my-folder`)
- File types
    - `.txt`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js`
- Mind your file path
    - `/../../../../../`
