## Peer-to-Peer Poetry: Invisible Cities

What if we could create and inhabit a new kind of digital city that transforms our online networks from something we passively receive to something we actively create? In this workshop we will collectively create a peer-to-peer city using the structure of nested folders and DAT. Through lecture, examples, and hands on making, we will explore folder structures as a new kind of narrative poetic structure and DAT as a way to build digital spaces with and for our networks.

This workshop assumes no coding experience and simultaneously takes the position that everyone who interacts with computers in some way is already a programmer.

## Session Objectives

- To create poetry through building a folder-based city on the peer-to-peer web for each other to inhabit during the duration of the workshop and beyond
- To create a space where we are having a conversation with computers and writing poetry with their logic
- To work with computers and DAT as collaborators
- To develop a taste for creating emotive and community centered software. 
- To introduce DAT
